Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 1 teaspoon of white pepper
- 2 tablespoons of coconut amino 
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil 

Directions:

add eggs, pepper, coconut amino, and some onions to a bowl. Wisk the mixture as you're preheating your pan to medium-high heat. Now, pour the mixture into the pan and allow it to start to congeal. Switch back and fourth between your hot burner and a cold one, this way you can regulate the temperature, without over cooking your eggs. Once, they're glossy, tranfer to a plate and add remaining green onions! Enjoy!
